🏴 Code of Conduct: Adult Meritocracy
1. Free Speech & Thick Skin
This project is dedicated to technical excellence, not social engineering. We do not police speech.
Expect bluntness. If your code is bad, you will be told it is bad. If your logic is flawed, it will be dismantled.
Ball-busting is part of the culture. We assume you are mature enough to ignore personal friction and focus on the technical objective.
No Nannies. There are no "safe spaces" or "tone policing" here. We do not mediate interpersonal disputes.
2. Low Governance
We have better things to do than manage your feelings.
Self-Moderate: If you find someone offensive or annoying, use the GitHub Block Feature.
No Reporting: Do not contact maintainers regarding "harassment" unless it involves illegal activity (e.g., doxxing, malware, or credible threats of violence).
Merit is the Only Metric: Contributions are accepted or rejected based on their quality and utility. Your background, identity, or "vibes" are irrelevant to the git merge command.
3. The Only Rules
We follow the GitHub Acceptable Use Policy because we have to, not because we want to. This includes:
No illegal content or malware.
No doxxing (posting private info).
No spamming the repo with garbage.
In short: Write good code, and don't expect a hug.
